{
  "SIMPLE_COVER_5E": {
    "Settings": {
      "CoverScope": {
        "Name": "Cover Removal Scope",
        "Hint": "Choose which tokens are affected when cover is cleared: everyone on the scene, only combatants, or player-owned tokens.",
        "Options": {
          "All": "All Tokens on Scene",
          "Combatants": "Combatants Only",
          "Player": "Player-Owned Tokens Only"
        }
      },
      "OnlyInCombat": {
        "Name": "Apply Cover Only In Combat",
        "Hint": "If enabled, automatic cover calculation only runs while a combat encounter is active."
      },
      "RemoveOnCombat": {
        "Name": "Clear Cover on Combat Updates",
        "Hint": "Automatically remove the Cover condition on combat changes (turn/round/initiative), honoring the selected Cover Removal Scope."
      },
      "RemoveOnMove": {
        "Name": "Clear Cover on Token Movement",
        "Hint": "Automatically remove the Cover condition when a token moves during active combat, honoring the selected Cover Removal Scope."
      },
      "losCheck": {
        "Name": "Wall Line of Sight Check",
        "Hint": "When enabled, the module also checks line of sight against sight-blocking walls. This can be used to detect cases where the target is fully blocked by walls."
      },
      "coverHints": {
        "Name": "Cover Hints in Roll Dialogs",
        "Hint": "When enabled, the module shows the current cover status in attack and saving throw roll dialogs."
      },
      "CreaturesHalfOnly": {
        "Name": "Limit Cover from Creatures to 1/2 Cover",
        "Hint": "When enabled, creatures can grant at most Half Cover. As soon as at least one line is blocked purely by creatures, the target gains Half Cover, but never Three-Quarters Cover from creatures alone. Walls continue to follow the standard DMG rules."
      },
      "IgnoreAllAOE": {
        "Name": "Ignore cover for all area effects",
        "Hint": "Skips cover checks whenever the activity defines any area template. If a template is present, no cover is calculated for that roll."
      },
      "IgnoreDistanceAOE": {
        "Name": "Ignore cover for ranged AoE templates",
        "Hint": "Skips cover checks for activities that create an area at range (e.g., Fireball). This applies when the activity has a range greater than 1 and uses an AoE template with range units other than self/touch/special."
      },
      "IgnoreDistanceSpace": {
        "Name": "Ignore cover for ranged space targeting",
        "Hint": "Skips cover checks when the activity targets a space at range (range > 1 and affects type is \"space\"). This is commonly used by summon features/spells, where the actual attack/effect is resolved from the summoned creature. Cover should be evaluated from the summon instead of the source feature/spell."
      },
      "Hover": {
        "Name": "Hover Cover Display",
        "Hint": "Controls whether and how cover information and distance are shown when hovering a token.",

          "Above": "Above the token",
          "On": "Centered on the token",
          "Below": "Below the token"
        }
      },
      "HoverLabelYOffset": {
        "Name": "Hover Label Y Offset",
        "Hint": "Additional vertical offset (in pixels) applied to the hover label position. Positive values move the label downward, negative values upward."
      },
      "HoverLabelXOffset": {
        "Name": "Hover Label X Offset",
        "Hint": "Additional horizontal offset (in pixels) applied to the hover label position. Positive values move the label to the right, negative values to the left."
      },
      "GridlessDistanceMode": {
        "Name": "Gridless Distance Mode",
        "Hint": "Choose how distance is measured on gridless scenes: center-to-center or edge-to-edge.",
        "Options": {
          "CenterCenter": "Center to center",
          "EdgeEdge": "Edge to edge",
          "EdgeToCenter": "Source edge to target center"
        }
      },
      "GridlessTokenShape": {
        "Name": "Gridless Token Shape",
        "Hint": "Controls how tokens in gridless scenes are approximated for distance and cover: as square footprints or as circular footprints with multi-circle layouts for larger creatures.",
        "Options": {
          "Square": "Square",
          "Circle": "Circular"
        }
      },
      "CreaturesProne": {
        "Name": "Prone Creature Height Adjustment",
        "Hint": "Controls how prone creatures are treated when building their 3D prism for cover calculations. When the \"Wall Height\" module is active, \"Treat as one size smaller\" falls back to half height.",
        "Options": {
          "None": "None",
          "LowerSize": "Treat as one size smaller",
          "Half": "Treat as half as tall"
        }
      },

        "Name": "Show Cover Debug Lines",
        "Hint": "Draw helper lines while computing cover between tokens (for debugging/troubleshooting)."
      },
      "CreatureHeights": {
        "Name": "Default Creature Heights",
        "Hint": "Default creature heights (in Grid Units) per size category used for 3D cover evaluation. When the \"Wall Height\" module is active, these defaults are ignored and heights are taken from that module instead."
      },
      "insetAttacker": {
        "Name": "Attacker Inset (px)",
        "Hint": "Moves the attacker's sampling points from the raw corner toward the token center (default: 1; max: 30% of the current grid size)."
      },
      "insetTarget": {
        "Name": "Target Inset (px)",
        "Hint": "Moves the target's sampling points from the raw corner toward the token center (default: 3; max: 30% of the current grid size)."
      },
      "insetOccluder": {
        "Name": "Occluder Inset (px)",

        "Name": "Configure Creature Heights",
        "Label": "Creature Heights",

        "BodyHint": "Set the default height (in Grid Units) for each creature size. These values are used when treating tokens as 3D prisms for cover. When the \"Wall Height\" module is active, these defaults are ignored and heights are taken from that module instead.",
