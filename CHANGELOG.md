# Changelog

## Version 0.3.0

- Added optional setting **Limit Cover from Creatures to Half Cover**: creatures can no longer grant ¾ cover (#2).
- Improved performance by skipping further checks when one attacker corner has fully clear line of effect.
- Added **gridless cover** support using virtual cells for large/huge tokens, approximating square-grid cover rules where no RAW gridless guidance exists (feedback and alternative approaches welcome).
- Improved Tiny creature cover on square/hex grids by using the token’s actual position within the cell.
- Added optional setting **Apply Cover Only In Combat** to run automatic cover calculation only while a combat encounter is active.

## Version 0.2.0

- Support for **Sharpshooter** and **Spell Sniper** when determining whether an attack ignores cover (#1)
- Added a dedicated **Creature Heights** settings menu
